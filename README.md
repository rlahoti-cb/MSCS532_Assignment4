## Part 1 Heapsort vs Mergesort vs Quicksort on Varying Data Sizes and Types
In this experiment we will be running the heapsort algorithm on varying data sizes (100000, 1000000 elements) and varying data types (sorted, random, reversed sorted).


In order to run the code to analyze heapsort performance, you can run:

```
python3 assignment_4_part_1.py
```

This will output the results to your terminal. I have captured my results to the `results_part_1.txt` file for the run that I am using in my analysis.

I have used the implementation from assignment 2 to capture data for the mergesort and quicksort algorithm on the same sizes of data and the same types of data. This data is also captured in the `results_part_1.txt` file.
